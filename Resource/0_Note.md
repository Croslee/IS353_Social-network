# Metrics Explanation

This document provides an overview of the key performance metrics used in evaluating the GNN recommendation system.

## Accuracy
- Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
- Higher accuracy indicates better overall model performance.

## Errors
- Represents misclassification or incorrect predictions.
- Lower error values indicate a more reliable model.

## F1 Score
- Combines precision and recall into a single score.
- A high F1 Score suggests a balance between precision and recall.

## Precision
- Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
- Indicates how many predicted recommendations are actually relevant.

## Recall
- Evaluates the ability to identify all relevant instances.
- Higher recall means the model captures more correct recommendations.

## RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- Calculates the difference between predicted and actual ratings.
- Lower RMSE values indicate more precise recommendations.

## Pipeline
- Represents the workflow of the recommendation system.
- Shows the steps involved in data processing and model training.

## Ratings
- Dataset used for training the GNN model.
- Contains user ratings that help in making recommendations.
